-	Can you help me find this “email” everyone keeps talking about?
-	Well, don’t you look dashing today!
-	I seem to have lost my way to the printer…
-	Well, hello there youngster!
-	Only 214 more centuries until retirement!
-	Need something, hon?
-	Oh, goodie! We meet again.
-	We simply have to stop meeting like this!

Red Right
-	Well, I am just appalled at your behavior!
-	There is no need for this kind of language!
-	No manners! Savage decorum, really!!
-	I would smite you if I had the power!
-	Pardon my French. FUCK OFFFFFFFFF
-	With you in my face, retirement couldn’t come any sooner!

Yellow Right
-	I dont quite follow your logic, dear. 
-	I’m not understanding…
-	I believe you’re losing me. 
-	Hold on, you can’t be serious…
-	Well, no need to be harsh.
-	You’re starting to ruffle my feathers that I stole from Ulama.

Green
-	Splendid!
-	Oh, joyous morn!
-	Back to work I go.
-	I think I can get this to work. Thank you!
-	Well, no time like the present!
-	Thanks for your help, dearie :)

Yellow Left
-	I judged Margaret Thatcher’s soul, and I think she might be a more likeable person than you.
-	Is there any amount of Werther’s I can give you to leave?
-	You’re lucky I’m not venomous, and a vegetarian!
-	Spiders can survive any fall due to their weight. You should remember that you cannot.

Red Left
-	Improper is what this is! Leave a lady to her devices, will you?!?
-	You mean less to me than the silk in my butt. Good day!
-	I may not have venom, but I do have pepper spray I will use if you don’t leave me alone!
