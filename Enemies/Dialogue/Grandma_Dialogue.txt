Can you help me find this “email” everyone keeps talking about?
Well, don’t you look dashing today!
I seem to have lost my way to the printer…
Well, hello there youngster!
Only 214 more centuries until retirement!
Need something, hon?
Oh, goodie! We meet again.
We simply have to stop meeting like this!

[RED RIGHT]
Well, I am just appalled at your behavior!
There is no need for this kind of language!
No manners! Savage decorum, really!!
I would smite you if I had the power!
Pardon my French. FUCK OFFFFFFFFF
With you in my face, retirement couldn’t come any sooner!

[YELLOW RIGHT]
I don't quite follow your logic, dear. 
I’m not understanding…
I believe you’re losing me. 
Hold on, you can’t be serious…
Well, no need to be harsh.
You’re starting to ruffle my feathers that I stole from Ulama.

[GREEN]
Splendid!
Oh, joyous morn!
Back to work I go.
I think I can get this to work. Thank you!
Well, no time like the present!
Thanks for your help, dearie :)

I judged Margaret Thatcher’s soul, and I think she might be a more likeable person than you.
Is there any amount of Werther’s I can give you to leave?
You’re lucky I’m not venomous, and a vegetarian!
Spiders can survive any fall due to their weight. You should remember that you cannot.

[RED LEFT]
Improper is what this is! Leave a lady to her devices, will you?!?
You mean less to me than the silk in my butt. Good day!
I may not have venom, but I do have pepper spray I will use if you don’t leave me alone!
