INT
Noooooo…. Our job IS each other!
*They whisper sweet nothings at each other, you feel a little sick*
We're not interested! Go away!
*They talk in perfect unison, it's kind of hypnotic*
We can't BOTH use Excel!
Isn't my partner adorable!?
Sshshsh… we're talking.
Huh? What? Sorry, if you're not my partner I don't care.
*They just sorta giggle at each other*
Noo! I'm not leaving them alone!
Can we get a two person job?
Nooo! Then we’ll have to separate!
*They ignore you and gaze lovingly into one another’s eyes*
*They open Word to type out sickly sweet letters to each other, at the same time.*
*They both try to type, the words overlap and make no sense.*
We ordered flowers for each other but they just burnt up in the hellish heat.
The chocolates we got for us are all melted!
Hm? Oh, you're still here?
Your voice literally doesn't register to us, we only hear each other.
We learned to talk at the same time so we can be even closer!
Okay! we can collaborate on the project then!
Good idea! We'll just combine our laptops too!
We'll each take half of the keyboard!
Maybe we'll learn more about each other by doing office work together!
Fine! My love looks beautiful when they're typing anyway.
Maybe if we get done early, we can leave for our date sooner!
We're both such good employees! We're perfect for each other!
Maybe this will add a new layer for our relationship!
We only love work when we're together.
Fine! We'll get started, but only because we want to be left alone.
PER
*Their overlapping voices are getting kind of disorientating*
*They start blasting early 2000s love songs to drown you out*
*They start to recite poems to each other, ignoring you*
Leave us alone!
You're so annoying!
The only thing that matters is each other!
*They start to kiss. You turn around until they stop*
You're just jealous!
We're watching The Notebook right now, buzz off.
You'll never find a partner if you keep acting like this.
*One of them starts crying, the other comforts them and looks at you angrily*
No wonder you don't have a partner! You're mean!
You'll NEVER be as happy as us!
*They both start booing you*
You're heartless!
You'll never tear us apart!
Interns are soooooo lonely!
Don't talk to us!
You can't get between us!
This job is interfering with our relationship!
