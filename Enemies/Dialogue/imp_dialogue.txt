AHaha! Raahh!!
No! No! No!
It gnaws on the linoleum floor*
Go away! I hate you!
It growls at you
It lunges and bites at you, grabbing hold of your hand. You fling your hand around trying to
shake it off, but its grip only tightens. It lets go once it swallows a ring off your finger.*
Rahrharaha *snorts
Fire! Brimstone! Falling Stock Prices!
I haaatee productivity! I'll eat it!
Awwoo0oo!
Hehehe! Maaybe!
No! No! No!
For a moment, seems to hear you. It shakes its head and then tries to bite you.
It spits at you*
Tomorrow! I'll do it tomorrow!
I hate when you make sense!
I don't even know what my job is!
It pauses to consider it's actions, and then veryyy gingerly pushes another glass off a table.*
Later! I'll do it later! For now, fire!â€‹
PER
Fine! Fine! Fine!
It spits out the table it had been eating, dejected.*
It regurgitates a laptop and starts to type.
Okay! I'll reinstall Slack!
Ah! Ah! Fine!
NoooOo! Mmmmm. Fine..
It frowns and starts to fake cry. It slowly puts out the fires around it, looking back on occasion while pouting to try and make you feel bad.*
It sits at a desk and growls at the screen, biting at the air, as it opens up Excel.*
Mmhmmh... maybe the worst form of destruction is contributing to Capitalism! Yay! Yay!
Fine! Fine! I'll burn things on break.
Never! Never! Never!
Shut up! Shut up!
It maintains eye contact as it starts to play Creed at full volume to drown you out. The only band allowed to play in hell.
It pours a glass of water all over a laptop, and then bites it in half*
It deletes Microsoft Word off of its computer to make room for RuneScape*
PBBBFFFTHHH *it blows a raspberry at you*
The more you talk! The more I break!
Mean! Meanie! Mean people don't get progress reports!
I ate HR! No one can stop me!
Rawr! Rawr!
Grrr bark! Bark! Bark!
I'll do destruction somewhere else!
You're mean to me!
Leave! Leave! Leave!
Steam starts to billow out of it's nose, it scratches at the ground like it might charge.* Fire! Fire! Get fired!
YOU do my work!
It starts to scout out new places to destroy*
Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!
