	15.	Do MY job? Go do YOUR job!  
	16.	*They... growl at you?*  
	17.	*They turn away. When you move to their face again, they turn back around. You walk around to  their front, but again they turn. This goes on for... a while.*

  30. *They place their hand on your forehead and keep you at arms length as they scroll on their  phone*  
   31. Ha! That was pretty funny, the thing you just said.  
   32. Maybe you have a point...  
    33. Can you get off my back?  
   34. Interesting point... What did you say?  
   35. Ha! You’re funny.  
  36. Give me five minutes, and then I probably won’t do it still.  
   37. *they put their finger to your mouth and shush you*  
    38. You’re really dedicated to this, huh?  
   39. Wowww you’re on your way to a raise for sure!  
   40. I’m sure the big boss man is really proud of you.  

	41.	Okay! Okay fine! I’ll get to work.  
	42.	Oh my Satan you’re annoying! Okay! Fine!  
	43.	Shut up! Stop talking! I’ll work! Fine!

   51. I’ll do my work if you stop talking, okay? Good. Now go harass someone else.  
  52. Spare me! Stop talking! I’ll get it done!  

53. *They begrudgingly close out of their movie and open up a spreadsheet, it’s a million cells long.  They start to sniffle as they start inputting numbers.*  
54 .Fine you psycho! I’ll get to work.  
55. You’re the absolute worst, fine! I’ll do my job, happy?  
56. If it makes you shut up, I’ll do anything. Including my job, I guess.  
57. You win! Stop it! Fine! I’m working! I'm working!  
58. If you’re THAT adamant about it, I guess I can get started.  

59. You’re worse than Satan! Fine! Get out of here and then I’ll get started.  
60 .Fine! Whatever! I can get some things done if it’ll get you to fuck off.  

	61.	You’re talking too much.  
	62.	Can you step off? You’re getting on my nerves.  
	63.	Careful...  
	64.	C’mon, that’s just too far.  
	65.	Woah, settle down.  
	66.	You’re getting a little too confident.  
	67.	This is funny now, but you’re getting really close to pissing me off.  
	68.	Is this really the best thing you could be doing right now?  
	69.	Alright kid, relax.  
70 . Go... do whatever Interns do, somewhere else. Away from me.  
71. Your voice is starting to make me angry.  
72. I’m getting more itchy the more you talk.  
73. This isn’t fun anymore.  
74. *They take a picture of you. You get a notification on your phone from the company-wide group  chat. It’s your face with the caption “When did we start hiring nerds?”*  
75. Okay pip-squeak you’re gonna lose talking privileges here soon.  
76.  *They repeat what you just said but in a high-pitched whiny voice* 17. Can I give you cash to leave me alone?
 77. You’re starting to make me mad, which is bad for you.
 78. This was fun, but it’s starting to get annoying. 
79.  Oh! You’re being serious? Red Right of Green 
80. Shut the hell up!  
81. You’re on my last nerve...  
82. Get out of my face!  
83. *They throw their mug at you, it shatters on the wall behind you.*  
84. You’ve got five seconds before I MAKE you leave me alone!  
85. I hate you! No! I’m not gonna do it.  
86. Careful... keep talking like that and you’ll be the one out of a job.  
87. Say that again and you’re getting thrown into the incinerator.  
88. For the love of Satan, just shut up!  
89. *They pick up a lighter and a can of aerosol, threateningly.*  
90. Oh shit you’re so annoying!  
91.You’re worse than the imps in the 5th circle!  
92. *They throw a book at you, the book is on fire.*  
93. *They start... barking at you?*  
94. I’m gonna bite you!  
95. If I ever see you again after this you’re getting locked in the Vending Machine, just like Tommy.  
96. Fuck you!  
97. Nuh uh! It’s not gonna happen!  
98. I hope Satan hears about this and kills you, but like... forever.  
99. I can NOT believe they promoted a wimp like you! You’re so lucky your manager died.
